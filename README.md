# etch-a-sketch

An interactive etch a sketch that uses basic JavaScript functionality including event listeners and DOM manipulation.

I tried to design it similary to the Etch A Sketch I had as a kid. Although the design itself is rather simple at the moment.

If I had more time, my wishlist would include: adding the classic white nobs to the bottom of the screen, having a 'shake' button to clear the screen, and perfecting the prompt/alert functionality so that in case the button is hit by accident that it does not clear the page upon click.
